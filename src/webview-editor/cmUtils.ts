 * Whether a mouse button is currently held down anywhere in the document.

 * A rendered block must not give way to its source in the middle of a drag. The
 * caret is dragged *through* a block on the way to somewhere else — and because
 * a blank line above a table resolves to document position 0, a press there
 * followed by a drag downward reads as a plain caret move whose head lands
 * inside the table, indistinguishable from a click on it. Unrendering then
 * swaps the rows out from under the pointer mid-gesture. Whether the button is
 * still down is what tells the two apart: a gesture in progress is not yet a
 * decision to edit.
 *
 * Tracked here, at module scope, because `cursorTouchesRange` is called from
 * pure state-derived code (decoration builders) that has no view or event to
 * consult. Listeners are attached once, in the capture phase so nothing can
 * stop them, and only when a DOM is actually present (the unit tests run in
 * plain Node).
